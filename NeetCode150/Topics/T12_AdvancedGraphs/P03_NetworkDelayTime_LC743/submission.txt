You are also given times, a list of directed edges where `times[i] = (ui, vi, ti)`.\n// - ui is the source node (an integer from 1 to n)\n// - vi is the target node (an integer from 1 to n)\n// - ti is the time it takes for a signal to travel from the source to the target node (an integer greater than or equal to 0).\n// Finally, we have k, the label of the Node that sends the signal\n//### Input format: \n//int[][] times, int n, int k\n//### Output format: int\n//### Result:\n//  minumum time it takes for all of the nodes to receive signal.\n//  -1 if it is impossible\n//### Example: ?\n//### Clarifications:\n//### Edge cases: ?\n//### Constraints:\n//### Observations: It is a directed, weighted graph.\n//### Approach: basically find the minimum spanning tree\n\npublic class Solution {\n    \n    public int NetworkDelayTime(int[][] times, int n, int k) {\n        //[IMPORTANT] THIS IS NOT MST PROBLEM, UNLIKE WHAT I INITIALLY THOUGHT!!\n        // ### Example:\n        //  Example of why MST does NOT necessarily give shortest path between 2 vertices.\n        // Graph:\n        // (A)----5---(B)----5---(C)\n        //  |                     |\n        //  |----------7----------| \n        //\n        // - For MST, edges A-B and B-C will be on MST with total weight of 10. \n        //      So cost of reaching A to C in MST is 10.\n        // - But in Shortest Path (SPT) case, shortest path between A to C is A-C, \n        //      which is 7. So, A-C here is 7. But, A-C was never on MST.\n        // - So, we can see that SPT in our problem would act as we want, because for\n        //      this case it would make max time for the signal to reach all nodes = 7.\n        //      Because right from the start, the same signal would be sent through multiple lines at once/concurrently.\n        // - MST would NOT work because it would make the max time = 10 (to reach all nodes), \n        //      it would have worked if we had some limitation stating a signal cannot \n        //      be cloned/split.\n\n        // ## MST VS. SPT:\n        // ### SPT usecases: [Shortest Path from Source to Any Node]\n        //  - When you have want to go from a single point to another final point, \n        //      without needing to visit any other nodes specifically.\n        //  - Or When you want to connect all points in a way that the distance of \n        //      all of them to A is minimum. (We don't care about total length of path)\n        //  - Or when you need to visit all points (from a source node), but can traverse \n        //      multiple branches at the same time (e.g. the same signal in a network is sent through all the wires) [same time == concurrently].\n        //  - Dijkstra can work on DIRECTED OR UNDIRECTED graphs.\n        // ### MST usecases: [Shortest Path with All Nodes Included]\n        //  - When you have to go to all nodes at least once, but you can only traverse \n        //      one branch at a time.\n        //  - The goal of this is algorithm is to minimize the cost to connect all the points \n        //      (e.g. minimizing length or cost of wire used for a telecommunications company trying to lay cable in a new neighborhood. If it is constrained to bury the cable only along certain paths (e.g. roads), then there would be a graph containing the points (e.g. houses) connected by those paths. The length or cost of buring wire along each road would be its weight.)\n        //  - Prim can work ONLY ON DIRECTED graphs.\n        // ### Observations: \n        // - It does seem SPT prefers performance (connection from source to each \n        //      node is minimized), \n        // - whereas MST prefers efficiency (total cost is minimized).\n        // - In this problem especially, since we can just send the same signal through\n        //      multiple branches parallely/concurrently and we want to minimize \n        //      the time it takes for all nodes to get the signal, we simply want to pick\n        //      paths such that all nodes receive the signal as fast as possible, even if\n        //      the overall cost (sum of all weights) is not minimzed.\n\n        // Example for MST vs Dijkstra:\n        // ```\n        // Nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4\n        // Edges:\n        // 1 -> 2 (weight = 1)\n        // 1 -> 3 (weight = 2)\n        // 2 -> 4 (weight = 1)\n        // 3 -> 4 (weight = 1)\n        //```\n        // Shortest Path Tree (SPT) from Node 1:\n        // Dijkstra's Algorithm:\n        // 1 -> 2 (cost = 1)\n        // 1 -> 3 (cost = 2)\n        // 2 -> 4 (cost = 2 via node 2)\n        // Total weight = 1+1+2 = 4\n        // SPT focuses on the shortest path from node 1 to all others.\n        // Prim's Algorithm from Node 1:\n        // 1 -> 2 (cost = 1)\n        // 1 -> 3 (cost = 2)\n        // 2 -> 4 (cost = 2 via node 2)\n        // Total weight = 1+1+2 = 4\n        // SPT focuses on the shortest path from node 1 to all others.\n\n\n        // MST (e.g. Prim's algorithm) is used to get the shortest path that connects all nodes, but not neccessarily the shortest distance to each node. Because at each\n        // Shortest Path (SPT) (e.g. Djikstra's Algorithm) is used to get shortest path FROM 1 node.\n        \n        // MST ensures a global minimum (sum of all weights) across the entire graph.\n        // SPT ensures a local minimum (shortest path) from the source node to each individual node.\n        \n        // MST may include edges that are not part of any shortest path but are necessary for minimizing the total connection cost.\n        // SPT only includes edges that lie along the shortest paths from the source.\n        \n        // The SPT is rooted at the source node, and the structure is DIRECTED (if the graph is directed).\n        // MST is an UNDIRECTED structure, focusing solely on connection without regard to direction or specific paths. (because it's a tree)\n\n        //\n\n        //(From the following resource: https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse373/23au/lessons/graph-algorithms/#:~:text=Dijkstra%27s%20algorithm%20gradually%20builds%20a,cost%20of%20its%20shortest%20path.)\n        // Just as Prim\u2019s algorithm built on the foundation of BFS, Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm can be seen as a variation of Prim\u2019s algorithm.\n        // Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm gradually builds a shortest paths tree on each iteration of the while loop. \n        // But whereas Prim\u2019s algorithm selects the next unvisited vertex based on edge weight (of each edge)\n        // alone, Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm selects the next unvisited vertex based on the \n        // sum total cost of its shortest path.\n\n        //Dijkstra's focus is on minimizing the weight from 1 vertex to all others (getting shortest paths to them, or to just one index)\n        //Prim's focus is minimizing total weight.
