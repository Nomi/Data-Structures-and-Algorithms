If you use N lines, you end up with a cycle (e.g. a square has 4 vertices and 4 edges, or two points with two edges between them, or one point with one edge to itself, etc.)).\n        //      - MST is the smallest subset of edges from a graph that still connects all of its nodes but also forms a Tree (Acyclical, Connected, & Undirected Graph as discussed in the point above).\n        //      - If the edges are weighted, then we minimize the total cost by taking a subset of the edges such that the cost is minimized while still satisfying the other conditions of the MST.\n        //          For unweighted, we just assume the weights to be 1 for all edges.\n        //      - There CAN be multiple valid solutions/MSTs (with same cost). We just return 1 of them, like in shortest path algorithms.\n        //      - The result will be one of the valid MSTs but in the form of an edge list.\n        //      - Unlike for Shortest path (where we start from source node), for MST it doesn't matter which node we start from (because all node need to be included anyway).\n        //      - For some Trees (like binary trees) we usually ignore the fact that they're directed (only parent has pointers to its children), but here it is more strict than that. \n        //          Meaning the edges really will not have any direction.\n\n        // Since we want the MST, we can use the following algorithms (read the MST section above first):\n        //  * Prim's Algorithm: [for Undirected & Connected Graphs] \n        //      - We use a `visited` HashSet because we don't want to visit a node more than once,\n        //          because that would lead to a cycle.\n        //      - We also use a MinHeap<weight, n1, n2>, which sorts based on weight/cost of the edges\n        //          because we want to pop/dequeue the minimum weight/cost edges first. (where n1 and n2 are the nodes for the edges)\n        //      - We start at any node and add its edges to the MinHeap AND add the node to the Visited set.\n        //      - Then keep iterating and for the current edge for each iteration, use the n2 as the node\n        //          and take all neighbors of the current node and add its edges them to the MinHeap (alongside their total weights (combined with how much it took get there))\n        //      - { At this point, the algorithm works almost exactly like Djikstra's algorithm.
