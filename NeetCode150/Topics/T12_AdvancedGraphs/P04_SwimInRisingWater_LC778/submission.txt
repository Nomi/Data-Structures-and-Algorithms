[FACT_3]\n        //  - [ALPHA_2 (might not be 100% applicable here??)]-> From [FACT_2] WE CAN CONFRIM WE WANT SHORTEST PATH BECAUSE: Since we want to minimize waiting time, we want to minimize the largest elevation in the path locally. \n        //          We don't care about the globally smallest sum of values/elevations (like we would in MST), but we care about minimizng the (local) elevation FOR EVERY \n        //          node in the path. Even if the sum of their elevations ends up being bigger (because we only wait for the time of the maximum elevation, then swim through that path in 0 seconds).\n        //  - For more, read up on my Dijkstra vs MST related comments in `Network Delay Time`\n        //  - ACTUALLY, about [ALPHA_2], it might not be fully relevant here because we of the modification made in [FACT_3] AND only needing the path from SRC to DST without needing every node ([FACT_1] & [ALPHA_1]).
