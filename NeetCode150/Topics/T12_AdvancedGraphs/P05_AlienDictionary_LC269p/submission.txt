(like in most, if not all, Advanced Graph problems from NC150. These are all because of limited time until the interview.)\n        \n        //FROM NEETCODE VIDEO: ACCORDING TO PROBLEM DESCRIPTION ONE EDGE CASE IS WHEN STRINGS ARE OF DIFFERENT LENGTH BUT ONE OF THEM IS A PREFIX OF ANOTHER e.g [prefixedword, prefix], WHICH IS WRONG AND WE CAN RETURN []\n        \n        //(NOTICING THAT YOU CAN AND ACTUALLY) CONVERTING IT TO GRAPH IS THE TRICKIER PART (using first differing character to form these relationships) [I can notice an EDGE CASE of a cyclc here i.e. a comes after b but b comes after a too]\n\n        //[IMP] AFTER CONVERTING IT GRAPH, WE CAN KNOW IT IS A TOPOLOGICAL SORT BECAUSE WE WANT A LIST(here, as a string) OF CHARACTERS WHERE EACH CHARACTER THAT COMES AFTER A CHARACTER WILL BE PLACED AFTER THAT CHARACTER.\n        //Also, multiple solutions means topological sort will work (because you can do topo sort in multiple ways).\n        //Now, in order to find where to sort, recall watching Neetcode's Topological Sort theory video from Advanced Algorithms course. You can use toposort from every node to build up the res. Watch the video again if needed, but here's a rough explanation anyway: E.g. if you start from the true first character, you will get all its children, otherwise if you start form its children you will get all of them and add them in correct order to result and mark it visited. Then call it from the parent which will try to call it for its children but we already have the result of this child and it is in visited, so we call for other children parallel to it and then append them (the order here doesn't matter because they're all before true root as needed and before their respective firsts), then we add the parent itself since all its children were added. \n        //Also recall that, from the same video, that it will also work for multiple connected component e.g. r>t>f, w>e. By the same approach even.\n        \n        // NOTE THAT TO AVOID THE CYCLE EDGE CASE I THOUGHT OF EARLIER, WE WILL EITHER NEED ANOTHER HASHSET FOR CURRENT PATH (so that if we visit a node in current path again, it means there's a cycle)\n        //  OR USE A DICTIONARY WITH A BOOL VALUE (false => Visited and Added to result once | true => Currently in the process of visiting (i.e. going to its children before adding it to result)). Meaning if we get true on a node we visit again, it was part of our path to get here and hence there's a cycle. \n        \n        //[IMP.] WE ONLY COMPARE A WORD TO THE ONE DIRECTLY NEXT TO IT!!!
