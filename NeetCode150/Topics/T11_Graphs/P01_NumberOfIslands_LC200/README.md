## Prerequisites
- [Matrix DFS](https://neetcode.io/courses/dsa-for-beginners/29) [from NeetCode's Course(s)]
- [Matrix BFS](https://neetcode.io/courses/dsa-for-beginners/30) [from NeetCode's Course(s)]


## Problem Description
Given a 2D grid `grid` where `'1'` represents land and `'0'` represents water, count and return the number of islands.

An **island** is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically and is surrounded by water. You may assume water is surrounding the grid (i.e., all the edges are water).   

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: grid = [
    ["0","1","1","1","0"],
    ["0","1","0","1","0"],
    ["1","1","0","0","0"],
    ["0","0","0","0","0"]
  ]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: grid = [
    ["1","1","0","0","1"],
    ["1","1","0","0","1"],
    ["0","0","1","0","0"],
    ["0","0","0","1","1"]
  ]
Output: 4
```


**Constraints:**
* `1 <= grid.length, grid[i].length <= 100`
* `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.

    <summary>Recommended Time & Space Complexity</summary>
    <p>
    You should aim for a solution with <code>O(m * n)</code> time and <code>O(m * n)</code> space, where <code>m</code> is the number of rows and <code>n</code> is the number of columns in the grid.

<details class="hint-accordion">  
    <summary>Hint 1</summary>
    <p>
    An island is a group of <code>1</code>'s in which every <code>1</code> is reachable from any other <code>1</code> in that group. Can you think of an algorithm that can find the number of groups by visiting a group only once? Maybe there is a recursive way of doing it.
    </p>

<details class="hint-accordion">  
    <summary>Hint 2</summary>
    <p>
    We can use the Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm to traverse each group independently. We iterate through each cell of the grid. When we encounter a <code>1</code>, we perform a DFS starting at that cell and recursively visit every other <code>1</code> that is reachable. During this process, we mark the visited <code>1</code>'s as <code>0</code> to ensure we don't revisit them, as they belong to the same group. The number of groups corresponds to the number of islands.

### 1. Depth First Search






```csharp
public class Solution {
    private static readonly int[][] directions = new int[][] {
        new int[] {1, 0}, new int[] {-1, 0}, 
        new int[] {0, 1}, new int[] {0, -1}
    };
    
    public int NumIslands(char[][] grid) {
        int ROWS = grid.Length, COLS = grid[0].Length;
        int islands = 0;

        for (int r = 0; r < ROWS; r++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < COLS; c++) {
                if (grid[r][c] == '1') {
                    Dfs(grid, r, c);
                    islands++;
                }
            }
        }

        return islands;
    }

    private void Dfs(char[][] grid, int r, int c) {
        if (r < 0 || c < 0 || r >= grid.Length || 
            c >= grid[0].Length || grid[r][c] == '0') {
            return;
        }

        grid[r][c] = '0';
        foreach (var dir in directions) {
            Dfs(grid, r + dir[0], c + dir[1]);
        }
    }
}
```

        }

        return islands;

    private void Bfs(char[][] grid, int r, int c) {
        Queue<int[]> q = new Queue<int[]>();
        grid[r][c] = '0';
        q.Enqueue(new int[] { r, c });

        while (q.Count > 0) {
            var node = q.Dequeue();
            int row = node[0], col = node[1];

            foreach (var dir in directions) {
                int nr = row + dir[0], nc = col + dir[1];
